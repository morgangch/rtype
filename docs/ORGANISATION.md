## 🧩 Task and Progress Management

### 🔹 **Tickets & tracking**

* Task management is done via **GitHub Projects**.
* Each ticket must include:

  * A **clear description** of the need.
  * One or more **assignees**.
  * A **realistic deadline**.
  * If applicable: a **milestone** (sprint).
* Tickets must be **linked to corresponding Pull Requests** via the *Development* tab.

---

### 🔹 **Rushes / Sprints**

* Each **weekly** marks the beginning of a new **sprint**.
* Tickets are grouped by **rush** in GitHub Projects.
* Priority tasks must be placed in the **"In Progress"** column.
* Completed tickets must be moved to **"Done"** once the PR is merged.

---

## 💬 Internal Communication

* All technical communication is done on the project's **Discord**.
* A specific `#absent-retard` channel is provided for:

  * Reporting any **planned absence**.
  * Notifying any **delay**.
* Important discussions or technical decisions must be **summarized and archived on Notion**.

---

## 🧾 Team Best Practices

* Respect meeting schedules and **avoid digressions** during stand-ups.
* Never block another member without communication (notify on Discord in case of unexpected issues).
* Update GitHub Projects tickets as soon as a task changes state.
* In case of technical disagreement:

  * Notify the **project lead** (`@mrGonzalezGomez`),
  * If no consensus is reached, an **internal vote** can be organized on the Discord `#sondage` channel.
