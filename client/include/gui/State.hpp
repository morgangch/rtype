     * The State class defines the interface that all concrete GUI states must implement.
     * It follows the state pattern to allow the application to change behavior based
     * on the current state (e.g., main menu, game lobby, settings, etc.).
     * 
     * Each state is responsible for:
     * - Handling user input events
     * - Updating its internal state and animations
     * - Rendering itself to the screen
     * - Managing state transitions (entry/exit)
     * 
     * Concrete implementations include:
     * - MainMenuState: The main game menu
     * - PublicServerState: Public server selection screen
     * - PrivateServerState: Private server creation/joining screen
     * - PrivateServerLobbyState: Lobby for private servers
     * 
     * @see StateManager for state management and transitions
