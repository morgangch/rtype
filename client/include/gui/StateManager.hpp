     * @class StateManager
     * @brief Manages a stack of GUI states for the application
     * 
     * The StateManager class implements a stack-based state management system
     * that allows for clean transitions between different GUI screens. It maintains
     * a stack of states where only the top state is active and receives events.
     * 
     * Key features:
     * - Stack-based state management (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
     * - Automatic state lifecycle management (onEnter/onExit)
     * - Event delegation to the active state
     * - Support for state overlays (multiple states can be active)
     * - Memory management using smart pointers
     * 
     * Common usage patterns:
     * - pushState(): Add a new state on top (e.g., opening a settings menu)
     * - popState(): Remove the top state (e.g., closing a dialog)
     * - changeState(): Replace the current state (e.g., going from menu to game)
     * 
     * Example:
     * @code
     * StateManager manager(window);
     * manager.pushState(std::make_unique<MainMenuState>(manager));
     * // In main loop:
     * manager.handleEvent(event);
     * manager.update(deltaTime);
     * manager.render();
     * @endcode
