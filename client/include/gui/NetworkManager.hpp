/**
 * @file NetworkManager.hpp
 * @brief Network management system for the R-TYPE client GUI
 * 
 * This file defines the NetworkManager class which provides a bridge between
 * the GUI system and the network communication layer. It manages network
 * connections, handles background networking operations, and provides
 * a clean interface for GUI states to interact with the network.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Non-blocking network operations
 * - Thread-safe network state management
 * - Integration with GUI state system
 * - Background network loop handling
 * - Connection status monitoring

     * @brief Manages network operations for the GUI system

     * The NetworkManager provides a high-level interface for GUI states to
     * interact with the network layer. It handles connection management,
     * background network operations, and thread-safe communication.
     * 
     * Usage example:
     * @code
     * NetworkManager networkManager;
     * networkManager.connectToServer("127.0.0.1", 8080, "PlayerName", 0);
     * 
     * // In update loop
     * networkManager.update();
     * 
     * if (networkManager.isConnected()) {
     *     // Handle connected state
     * }
     * @endcode
